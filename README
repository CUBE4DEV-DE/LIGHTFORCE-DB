The LIGHTFORCE DB is a library designed for storing C++ objects both in memory and persistently in a JSON database. It consists of four modules, each of which can be integrated into your own application as a DLL library. The CoreStorage module is responsible for file access, acting as a tool to manage the storage and retrieval of files.

At the heart of the LIGHTFORCE DB is the CoreBase module, which manages data. This central component of the database ensures that data is organized and handled efficiently, facilitating smooth operations and data transactions within the application.

To manage general processes within the application, the CoreProcess module is utilized. This module aids in the supervision and management of various processes that occur, ensuring that operations run smoothly and without interruption.

Lastly, the CoreNetwork module serves to represent elementary web client architectures. It allows for the easy creation and management of web client structures, providing essential functionalities to facilitate network communication and interactions within the web space.

Together, these modules work in harmony to provide a robust and efficient database system capable of handling C++ objects with a high degree of efficiency and effectiveness.
